Placing your monitor at eye level has the potential to improve         your posture and make you more comfortable while at work, helping you stay focused on the task at hand.        Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra desk space below your computer         to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under the stand.                <section>          <div class="flex flex-jc-sb">            <h2>Bamboo Stand</h2>            <h3>Pledge $25 or more</h3>          </div>          You get an ergonomic stand made of natural bamboo.
